## Selected Approach: Modern Minimalist with Warm Accents

**Rationale:** This approach balances professionalism with warmth, making it ideal for a service that bridges cultural connection. The minimalist structure ensures clarity for users understanding the service, while warm colors and human-centered design create emotional connection.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Warm terracotta and saffron primary colors reflecting Indian heritage
- Playfair Display for elegant, distinctive headings
- Asymmetric layouts with diagonal dividers creating visual interest
- Testimonial-focused sections highlighting human connection
- Smooth, purposeful animations that enhance rather than distract
